**Let's code our first game!**

Create a Tictactoe in React JS. Remember to follow the recommended workflow to start coding:

- Design your sitemap: How many pages/views?
- Designing your wireframe: What components and where?
- Start coding your components only rendering "Hello world" on each of them (to make sure they work).
- Create a list of all the possible user and system interactions (events) that occure during runtime (for example: The user clicks on a button to start the game)
- Create a javascript functions that will handle each of those events.
- Console.log on each of those funtions to make sure they are being called.

**Concepts we are using:**
- State of the components (global variables)
- Props
- Render method
- The function for checking the winner is a great learning algorithm
